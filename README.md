Description:

The Traffic Analyzer project is an intelligent system designed to analyze vehicular traffic patterns with a focus on providing insights into congestion scenarios. Leveraging cutting-edge sensors and advanced data analytics, the system operates on a unique principle: it calculates the average traffic density over a 5-minute interval. If this average exceeds a predefined threshold, the system initiates a detailed analysis.

Key Features:

Average Traffic Analysis: The project employs sophisticated algorithms to calculate the average traffic density over a 5-minute interval, offering a more nuanced understanding of traffic conditions.

Threshold-based Analysis: By comparing the calculated average with a predefined threshold, the system identifies instances where traffic congestion is likely.

Real-time Monitoring: Users can observe real-time traffic updates, ensuring prompt awareness of any congestion issues.

Dynamic Thresholds: The system dynamically adjusts congestion thresholds based on historical data, adapting to changing traffic patterns and optimizing accuracy.

How it Works:

Data Collection: Utilizes state-of-the-art sensors to collect real-time data on vehicle movements.

5-Minute Interval Analysis: Processes the collected data in 5-minute intervals, generating average traffic density values.

Threshold Comparison: Compares the calculated average with a dynamic congestion threshold.

Alerts and Detailed Analysis: If the threshold is surpassed, the system triggers alerts and initiates a detailed analysis to identify the cause and potential solutions
